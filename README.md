# Configuring Group Policy
<h2>Description</h2>
This is a walkthrough on creating a Group Policy Object (GPO) to install Notepad++ and update the desktop wallpaper of connected Windows 10 clients. This GPO grabs the Notepad++ install and image from a File Share named Share on the network. In the future, If I scale up the number of clients, having a GPO handle install updates is much faster than manually updating every machine on the network.
<h2>Environments Used</h2>
- <b>Windows Server 2019</b> (17763) </br>
- <b>Windows 10</b> (22H2)
<h2>Utilities Used</h2>
- [WiX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/)
<h2>Group Policy Configuration Walkthrough</h2> 
To start, I create a folder named Share containing a Notepad++ installer and image on the Domain Controller. I configure Share Permissions to allow Authenticated Users to read from the folder, and to allow Domain Admins to have Full Control. When I check into my Windows 10 client, the Share folder appears when accessing \\DC\.

Now that the installer is accessable, I create a GPO link for my _DOMAIN_COMPUTERS Organizational Unit (OU) called Notepad++ Install. Under Group Policy Management Editor, I created a package that points to the N++ installer in the network share. I then run /gpupdate on the client to initiate the Group Policy update.

After restarting, I'm able to log in and verify Notepad++ is installed to the client.

Now that Notepad++ is installed, I created another GPO that changes the desktop wallpaper to another image. I linked it to the _USERS OU so it will apply to every user that isn't the admin. I ran gpupdate /force and restart the client. The policy was enforced.... however, I had forgotten that non-activated versions of Windows cant be personalized, so the background was changed to black screen. Oops.

<h2>Issues </h2>
Outside of the desktop background issue, the main issue I ran into was forgetting that the Notepad++ installer was an .exe and not a .msi. This probably isn't the safest or most ideal way to handle this, but for the purpose of really wanting to do this in a lab environment I repackaged the .exe as an .msi using This site was built using WiX Toolset.
